                            `I’m a front-end web developer, with skills on the back-end. 
                            I utilize information theory, visual art skills, and my pedagogical 
                            background to structure intuitive user experiences. I recently earned 
                            a certificate in full-stack development from the University of Pennsylvania, 
                            focusing on JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, and Object-Oriented programming. I develop 
                            responsive, mobile-first designs where form and function mingle toward marriage. 
                            Modernism with a soul is my motto. I’m motivated by highly-skilled teams, and 
                            pair programming, that harmonizes technical and aesthetic skills. And I recently 
                            worked on successful teams, within an agile framework, to create two well-received MVPs. 
                            I’m excited to continue learning, designing, and deploying with a quality-first team.`
